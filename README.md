# GAS Git Workflow Template

This repository is a **starter template** for managing a Google Apps Script project with Git. It sets up a clean development workflow with separate **DEV** and **PROD** environments, version-controlled Git hooks, and helper scripts to make pushing and promoting code safe and predictable.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Two environments (DEV/PROD)**  
  ‚Äì `.clasp.dev.json` and `.clasp.prod.json` are included with placeholders for your own Script IDs.  
  ‚Äì Easy one-time initialization (`scripts/init-ids.sh`) to insert your real IDs.  

- **Git hook automation**  
  ‚Äì A `pre-push` hook runs `clasp push` to keep your DEV environment always in sync when you push to Git.  
  ‚Äì Hooks are version-controlled under `.githooks/` so they work consistently across clones.  

- **Promotion flow**  
  ‚Äì `scripts/promote-to-prod.sh` safely promotes the current code to PROD.  
  ‚Äì Checks that you are on a clean `main` branch, with optional tagging for release notes.  

- **Diff tooling**  
  ‚Äì `scripts/gas-diff.sh` lets you compare two GAS projects (by Script ID or local folders).  
  ‚Äì Supports unified diff or just a summary list of added/modified/deleted files.  

- **Safe configuration management**  
  ‚Äì `.clasp.json` is ignored in Git (it‚Äôs always a generated/temporary file).  
  ‚Äì Scripts automatically copy the correct config (`.clasp.dev.json` or `.clasp.prod.json`) before pushing.  

- **Minimal starter code**  
  ‚Äì Includes a simple `Code.gs` with a `myFunction()` that logs a message so you can verify the pipeline works immediately.  
  ‚Äì `appsscript.json` is pre-configured with V8 runtime and safe defaults.

## üöÄ How to use this template

This repository is set up as a **GitHub Template**. To start a new Google Apps Script project with this workflow:

1. On the repo page, click the green **‚ÄúUse this template‚Äù** button (top-right).

2. Choose **‚ÄúCreate a new repository‚Äù**, give it a name, and pick visibility (public/private).

3. Clone your new repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/<your-new-repo>.git
   cd <your-new-repo>
   ```

4. Install [clasp](https://github.com/google/clasp?tab=readme-ov-file#install) and log in:
   ```bash
   npx @google/clasp login --no-localhost
   ```

5. Initialize your Script IDs:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/init-ids.sh  # enters DEV and PROD IDs once and saves them into the JSON configs
   ```

6. Enable versioned hooks:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/install-hooks.sh
   ```

7. Push to DEV (automatically via pre-push) or manually:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/push-dev.sh
   ```

8. Release to PROD when ready:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/release.sh
   ```

  pre-push            # runs clasp push to DEV
scripts/              # helper scripts
  init-ids.sh         # set your real DEV/PROD Script IDs
  init-hooks.sh       # configure git to use .githooks/ as hooksPath
  push-dev.sh         # push code to DEV
  promote-to-prod.sh  # promote code to PROD safely
  release.sh          # create annotated release tags and push
  gas-diff.sh         # compare two GAS projects
src/                  # your Apps Script source files
  Code.gs             # starter code (hello world)
.clasp.dev.json       # DEV config (with placeholder Script ID)
.clasp.prod.json      # PROD config (with placeholder Script ID)
.gitignore            # ignores .clasp.json and build artifacts
```

## üì¶ Why use this template?

- Keeps your Apps Script projects under **version control**.  
- Makes it easy to **separate DEV and PROD** safely.  
- Automates away the noisy `.clasp.json` switching.  
- Provides tooling to **diff and review** before promoting.  
- Works out of the box for **bound scripts** (Sheets, Docs, etc.) and standalone Apps Script projects.
